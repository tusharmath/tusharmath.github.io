These are my personal notes from [David Flanagan's Javascript the Definitive Guide](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596805531.do). I though I will share them with everyone in terms of a **Q&A** format. I will cover each chapter one by one but since Chapter 1 and 2 are very basic I have started with chapter three. If I get time I will put questions from Chapter 2 as well. Please note that these are my own notes and it is possible that I might have not explained certain concepts in great detail. In case you have more doubts about a question post it in the comments section or refer to the amazing book for more details.

_Trust me on this, if you go through these questions diligently one chapter per day then in twenty two days there will be no interview that you can not crack :)_
