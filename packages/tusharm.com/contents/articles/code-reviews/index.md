Code reviews in organizations are quite different and probably more challenging in my opinion than typical open-source projects.

## 🥴 Challenges

- More often than not, people of different levels of skills & experiences contribute to the same code base.
- There is an explicit hierarchy within the team (captain, manager etc.) that can influence the review process.
- Very often you are working with folks who are trying to meet an external deadline on a project that has not yet found a product-market fit.
- Some projects are green-field, so there is less structure both in terms of code and organization. Setting up standards too soon might turn out to be counter productive.
- Similarly some projects are huge, monolithic legacy systems with teams that are used to certain kinds of processes and setup.
- You need to collaborate with stake holders in other teams viz Product, Design, QA, etc.

To have an effective code review setup, you need to incorporate these concerns for your team and organization. There will be things that work really well for some projects but fail miserably for others, **context is key here**.

It's not all that bad when it comes to code reviews, there are quite a few benefits of working in an organization also, viz.

## 💃 Benefits

- For starters, most of the developers are working on the same floor, in the same time zone. This is a massive collaboration booster, as there is less time spent in writing one-time-read documentations, articulating your arguments or waiting for someone to respond to your queries.
- The folks you are working with are not contributors who are "donating" their time to your project. They are engineers who are committed to work with you to achieve a common goal long term.

# Having Effective Code Reviews

## 😇 Setup a Culture

- Code reviews should be looked at, as a part of your **engineering culture** rather than a process.
- Developers should feel **safe** to communicate their opinions, whether they agree or disagree with something.
- Some people that you collaborate with might be new to the project or technology. For them, code reviews should be centered around making them learn and onboard faster.
- Encourage people in their initial reviews. Sending a **congratulatory note** publicly, on someone's first PR getting merged or for some long stuck PR, really helps!
- It's not just this one PR that needs your review, there are going to be many more across multiple projects. Encourage building a healthy rapport within your team.

## 🗣 Have Effective Communication

- Derogatory or offensive feedback should be flagged.
- Nitpicking should be marked explicitly, use **#nitpick** if you want to be extra clear.
- Review feedback should emphasize on facts instead of feelings and opinions.
- Exploit the fact that the developers are on the same floor. Block your calendar and have a face to face discussion instead of doing it over tools (Github, Gitlab etc.).

## 💪 Empower the Team

- Let the team that's actually working on the project decide the guidelines and processes for themselves.
- Hierarchical reviews (eg. captain reviewing her team) should be avoided as much as possible, they have a negative impact on the overall engineering culture.
- All reviews should be preferably done within your team and amongst peers.
- There should be minimum dependencies between teams for pull request approvals.

## 📝 Have a Developer Guideline

- If you don't have it, create one! They are the most effective way of improving code review efficiency.
- Investing time in it, reviewing it frequently, and making it a part of the onboarding process saves a lot of time later.
- It's sometimes better to have a coding guidelines that is easier maintain because of already available tooling.

## 👮‍♀️ Create Domain Owners

- Create specific owners for certain parts of your software.
- Owners' approval should be necessary for any changes made to those pieces.
- Don't have only one owner for anything 😓

## 🤷‍♀️ Separate Subjective from Objective Feedback

- There should be a very clear distinction between Objective and Subjective feedback while sharing it with the contributor. Use tags such as **#IMO** ie. "In my opinion", or **#IMHO** ie "In my humble opinion"
- Objective feedback is the one that has been agreed upon as a group. It is in adherence to the project's contribution guidelines. It flags — logical deficiencies, performance issues, high maintenance or reliability costs. It should remain **non-negotiable**.
- Subjective feedback is an opinionated way of doing something. This should not be mandated even if it's given by the domain owner or your captain.
- This distinction can save a lot of [bike shedding] time later.

## 🧐 Stay on Subject

- It's easy to get distracted and start providing feedback about stuff that's already running in production. This should be completely avoided.
- Open an issue on Jira (you are not an org otherwise 😇) if you want to propose a change in existing code.

## ⏱ Allow Deferring Proposed Changes

- Sometimes, the proposed changes are quite large and contributors need to meet external deadlines.
- The contributors should be allowed to make an issue (on Jira!) for follow-up changes after the current PR is merged.
- Alternatively use a TODO comment with a due date and name tag eg: **TODO(1-JAN-2020@tusharmath)** inside the codebase. Setup lint rules on the CI that flags such todo comments when the due date is missed.

## 🛠 Leverage Tooling

- Tooling is critical in making reviews efficient. Be open to explore paid tools that help in collaborating and reviewing better.
- Anything that can be automated should be automated.
- Running tools locally as a pre-commit hook, works well for small projects but integrating with CI is a must for large projects.
- Maintain historical data of your builds. Push your code metrics such as build time, artifact size, test coverage, flaky tests, files changed etc. to an external analytics system.
