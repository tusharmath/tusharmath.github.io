Super Cache is a chrome extension that I created to control caching behavior from the client side.

## Features

- Override caching policy that has been set on the server.
- Select a host on which the caching is required and all requests from a page with that host will be cached.
- Caching of static content which are on a different host will also be cached _(read Note for further explanation)_

Grab it from [Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/super-cache/fglobbnbihckpkodmeefhagijjcjnbeh)

**Note:** say you have a site _example.com_ on which you have set a caching policy thru the extension.
Now if the any page on _example.com_ links to external scripts and sites which are on a different domain such as static.example.com or ajax.googleapis.com, the extension will automatically apply the same caching behavior as that of _example.com_

**Caution:** Caching takes up disk space, so use the extension carefully.
