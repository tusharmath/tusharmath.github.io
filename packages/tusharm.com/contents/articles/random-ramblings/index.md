### Astrology vs Machine Learning ~ 2 Apr 2015

Is astrology an age old machine learning (ML) algorithm that is predicting the future, just like ad networks, that predict the click thru rate of an ad for the current user? Have I been ignorant all this while, failing to find the logic of causation in astrology, without realizing that:

> Correlation does not imply causation

the premise on which ML exists.
