I was learning words for GRE when I found this site - [mnemonicdictionary.com](http://mnemonicdictionary.com). It uses mnemonics to aid you in memorizing words. I went through the **Barrons GRE List** of words but as I was going through it realized how poor the website was constructed. I wanted to put all these words on one page so that I can search the words quickly using the native browser search plus I wanted it to be available offline.

So I used my [html-scraper](https://github.com/tusharmath/html-scraper) to extract all the data and put it into a json file and then created [this web page](words.html) out of it. I will later add some more features to improve the performance of the page so that the size of the page reduces.
