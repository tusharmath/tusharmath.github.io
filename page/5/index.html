<p>It took a lot of perseverance in getting the recipe just right. So here are some DOs and <span class="caps">DON</span>’Ts for making mutton dum biryani (_same applies for chicken biryani_). These points are an extension of the Hyderabadi style biryani which is cooked in layers of meat and<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>rice.</p>
