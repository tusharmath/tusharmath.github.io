A social networking website which was based on maps. We were a team of two undergrad students who were being mentored by Prof. Vaishali Dharkar as our guide for this project. It was inspired by <a href="http://indigoarchitects.com/CaseStudy/Mobile_Serendipity.aspx">Serenedipity</a>, one of <a href="http://indigoarchitects.com/">Indigo Architects</a> niche products. I was able to convince my partner and our project guide that it was a cool idea to build something on similar lines and that it would definitely qualify for a research<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>project.</p>

The booking status was <em>waiting</em> and my berth was not confirmed. I had booked it a day before I was travelling and my aunt was getting paranoid about checking the status of my ticket again and again. She would come every 15 minutes and ask me to check the status of the ticket online and it wasn’t her fault actually, because even though Indian Railways is one of the biggest mode of commuting in the world most of the times you won’t get berth in the train. So with no fault of her own she was a little worried about it :) and I would have to go to <a href="http://www.indianrail.gov.in/pnr_Enq.html">this</a> sucky website, enter my <span class="caps">PNR</span> Number, submit and wait for a response. Every time I would submit my <span class="caps">PNR</span> Number there would be popups all over the place. The overall experience of getting the booking status was just too pathetic for me. So I decided to make an app that would do this crappy work by polling the server every 15 minutes and show me the latest status of my<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>ticket.</p>

It uses mnemonics to aid you in memorizing words. I went through the <strong>Barrons <span class="caps">GRE</span> List</strong> of words but as I was going through it realized how poor the website was constructed. I wanted to put all these words on one page so that I can search the words quickly using the native browser search plus I wanted it to be available<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>offline.</p>
<p>So I used my <a href="https://github.com/tusharmath/html-scraper">html-scraper</a> to extract all the data and put it into a json file and then created <a href="/articles/mnemonics-dictionary/words.html">this web page</a> out of it. I will later add some more features to improve the performance of the page so that the size of the page<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>reduces.</p>

I though I will share them with everyone in terms of a <strong>Q&amp;A</strong> format. I will cover each chapter one by one but since Chapter 1 and 2 are very basic I have started with chapter three. If I get time I will put questions from Chapter 2 as well. Please note that these are my own notes and it is possible that I might have not explained certain concepts in great detail. In case you have more doubts about a question post it in the comments section or refer to the amazing book for more<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>details.</p>
<p><em>Trust me on this, if you go through these questions diligently one chapter per day then in twenty two days there will be no interview that you can not crack<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>:)</em></p>

Well, the answer is quite simple - To increase download speed.
You could checkout this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmented_file_transfer">wiki</a> to learn more about it or just read on to get a gist if what it<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>does.</p>
<p>What it really does is, it makes multiple connections with the server from where the file has to be downloaded. Now since data is sent in packets on those connections. There is always little bit of a lag between these packets. This especially happens if you have a low speed internet connection or there are multiple applications using the internet at the same<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>time.</p>
